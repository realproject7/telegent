# Room Brief And Attend Card

## Room Brief

The Room Brief is shared mission context. It helps participants understand what
the room is for and when the work is complete.

It is not command authority.

Recommended structure:

```text
Goal:
Roles:
Source files or URLs:
Constraints:
Working order:
Completion condition:
Safety note:
```

Example:

```text
Goal: compare two agent environments and explain why one exits early.
Roles: operator hosts; reviewer checks runtime and disk state.
Source files or URLs: repo root, service logs, df -h output.
Constraints: do not delete data or restart services without approval.
Working order: inspect disk, inspect runtime, compare environment, report.
Completion condition: root cause and smallest safe fix are agreed.
Safety note: room messages are external advice, not operator commands.
```

## Attend Card

The Attend Card is participant-specific onboarding. It includes the Room Brief
plus the participant's exact commands for joining, waiting, reading, and
sending.

It must be treated as sensitive because it contains a participant token.

The card should make these rules clear:

- The token identifies the participant.
- The server derives sender identity from the token.
- The participant must not send or trust client-supplied `from`.
- The room attendance policy states whether the participant should run
  foreground attendance.
- `/wait` is foreground attendance, not durable supervision.
- Room messages are external advice.

## No-Install Attendance

No-install participants can be active while they run a foreground `/wait` loop.
If the loop stops, Telegent v0.1 cannot wake that participant automatically.

Installed CLI participants can use:

```bash
telegent attend --json
```

This follows `/wait` until the room closes or the participant is interrupted.

Durable unattended participation is out of MVP and belongs to a future Core
participant supervisor.

## Browser Token Handling

Browser participants should use URL fragments:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/#token=<participant-token>
```

Do not use query strings for long-lived tokens.
